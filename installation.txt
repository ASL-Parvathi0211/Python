2 modes of executing the program:
    # interactive modes(where we interact with the software directly..)
    # Script mode( saving the logic in a file and executing it with the respective software.)

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3.11

macOS
brew install python3 && cp/usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python

2modes of executing the program:
    # Interactive mode (where we intract with software directly)
    # Script mode(Saving the logic in a file and executing with the respective software)
